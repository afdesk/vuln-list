  "Description": "A vulnerability was discovered in ImageMagick where a specially created SVG file loads itself and causes a segmentation fault. This flaw allows a remote attacker to pass a specially crafted SVG file that leads to a segmentation fault, generating many trash files in \"/tmp,\" resulting in a denial of service. When ImageMagick crashes, it generates a lot of trash files. These trash files can be large if the SVG file contains many render actions. In a denial of service attack, if a remote attacker uploads an SVG file of size t, ImageMagick generates files of size 103*t. If an attacker uploads a 100M SVG, the server will generate about 10G.",

    "rodrigo-zaiden\u003e vulnerability was added at some point in 6.9.x. It does not reproduce in older versions. In Ubuntu it affects bionic and later.",
    "rodrigo-zaiden\u003e additional patchs may be needed, some data structures are not available in ImageMagick6, and there is no commit from upstream in ImageMagick6."
