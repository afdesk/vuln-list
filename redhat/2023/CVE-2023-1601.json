  "details": [
    "This CVE exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-4206. The cursor_alloc() function still accepts a signed integer for both the cursor width and height. A specially crafted negative value could make datasize wrap around and cause the next allocation to be 0, potentially leading to a heap buffer overflow. A malicious privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host or potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of the QEMU process."
