    "All versions of the package angular are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via the \u003cinput type=\"url\"\u003e element due to the usage of an insecure regular expression in the input[url] functionality. Exploiting this vulnerability is possible by a large carefully-crafted input, which can result in catastrophic backtracking.",
    "A flaw was found in AngularJS, where it is vulnerable to a denial of service caused by a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) flaw in the input[url] functionality. By providing specially-crafted regex input, a remote attacker can cause a denial of service."
