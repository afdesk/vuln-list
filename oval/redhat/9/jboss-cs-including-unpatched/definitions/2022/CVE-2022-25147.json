    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library. This issue may allow a malicious attacker to cause an out-of-bounds write due to an integer overflow when encoding/decoding a very long string using the base64 family of functions. \n            STATEMENT: This flaw is only exploitable when the user of the APR library uses the base64 encoding/decoding family of functions provided by the API with a string bigger than 2GiB to cause an integer overflow and later in the out-of-bounds write.\n\nThis flaw was rated with an important severity as it allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service to the application linked to the library.",
