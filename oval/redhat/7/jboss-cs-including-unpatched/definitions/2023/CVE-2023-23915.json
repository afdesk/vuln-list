    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the Curl package, where the HSTS mechanism could fail when multiple transfers are done in parallel, as the HSTS cache file gets overwritten by the most recently completed transfer. This issue may result in limited confidentiality and integrity. \n            STATEMENT: There is no HSTS support in the versions of curl shipped in rhel-7 and rhel-8. Curl packages as shipped in rhel-9 do not support HSTS.",
