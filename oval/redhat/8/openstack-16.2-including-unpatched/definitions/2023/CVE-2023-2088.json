    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in OpenStack due to an inconsistency between Cinder and Nova. This issue can be triggered intentionally or by accident. A remote, authenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by detaching one of their volumes from Cinder. The highest impact is to confidentiality. \n            STATEMENT: There are two ways this flaw can be triggered:\n\nIntentional Type - A malicious user could use Cinder to detach their own volume. As Nova is not made aware of the situation, it might later grant the attacker access to a new volume of another user (later referred to as victim). As there are very little restrictions on how often this can be triggered and the victim might not have any way to identify if their volumes have been compromised,  the impact to Cinder has been rated Critical. \n\nAccident Type - This can occur if communication between Nova and Cinder is interrupted during a volume detachment process. A potential attacker seeking to exploit this type would need real-time access to logs and the ability to tamper with the private network. Due to these significant restrictions against triggering the vulnerability, components affected by this type are rated as Important.\n            MITIGATION: Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13: https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7012184\nRed Hat OpenStack Platform 16 and newer: https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7012327",
