    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the mod_dav module of httpd. A specially crafted \"If:\" request header can cause a memory read or write of a single zero byte due to a missing error check, resulting in a Denial of Service. \n            STATEMENT: This flaw only affects configurations with mod_dav loaded and configured. Also, if there is no WebDAV repository configured, the server is not affected and no further mitigation is needed. For more information about the mitigation, check the mitigation section below.\n\nThe httpd mod_dav module is enabled by default on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7, 8, 9, and in RHSCL. However, there is no WebDAV repository configured by default.\n\nThis flaw has been rated as having a security impact of moderate, and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 is now in Maintenance Support 2 Phase of the support and maintenance life cycle. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata.\n            MITIGATION: Disabling mod_dav and restarting httpd will mitigate this flaw.",
